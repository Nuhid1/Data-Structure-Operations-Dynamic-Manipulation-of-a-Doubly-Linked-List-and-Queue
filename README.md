# 🔗 Data-Structure-Operations: Dynamic-Manipulation-of-a-Doubly-Linked-List-and-Queue

## 📘 Overview

This C++ project demonstrates the manipulation of core linear data structures—**doubly linked lists** and **queues**—through a series of condition-based operations. It covers element insertion and deletion based on values and positions, and performs transformation of list data into a queue for further processing.

## ⚙️ Features

### 🧷 Doubly Linked List Operations
- Create an initial list: `{16, 29, 7, 42, 13}`
- ✅ Insert `11` after the second element
- ❌ Delete the element two positions ahead of the number `7`
- ✅ Insert `5` at the position equal to the number of even elements in the list
- ❌ Delete the element **at the position of the highest number** in the list

### 📥 Queue Operations
- Enqueue all **even elements** from the final list
- Dequeue one element from the queue
- Enqueue the **sum of the current front and rear elements**
- Display the queue after each operation

## 📊 Sample Output

```
Linked list elements are : 16 -> 5 -> 29 -> 11 -> 7 -> 
Queue elements are : 16 -> 
Queue elements are : 
Queue is empty
```
